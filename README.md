# Iris Prediction using KNN

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the species of iris flowers based on the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species label for each iris sample.

## Overview

The KNN algorithm is a simple and effective classification algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their K nearest neighbors. In this project, we use the KNN algorithm to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and is commonly used for classification tasks. It consists of 150 samples, each belonging to one of three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset contains 50 samples for each species, with four features measured for each sample.

## Usage

To run this project, make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. You can then execute the main script to load the Iris dataset, preprocess the data, train the KNN model, and make predictions.
