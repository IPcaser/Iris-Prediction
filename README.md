# Iris Prediction using KNN

This project implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the species of iris flowers based on the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species label for each iris sample.

## Overview

The KNN algorithm is a simple and effective classification algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their K nearest neighbors. In this project, we use the KNN algorithm to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and is commonly used for classification tasks. It consists of 150 samples, each belonging to one of three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset contains 50 samples for each species, with four features measured for each sample.

## Usage

To run this project, make sure you have Python installed on your system along with the necessary libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn. You can then execute the main script to load the Iris dataset, preprocess the data, train the KNN model, and make predictions.

## Files

- `iris_prediction.py`: Main script containing the implementation of the KNN algorithm for iris prediction.
- `iris.csv`: Dataset file containing the Iris data.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the required Python libraries and their versions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `iris_prediction.py` script to train the model and make predictions.

## Results

The accuracy of the KNN model on the Iris dataset can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The performance of the model can be further analyzed through techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Conclusion

Iris prediction using the KNN algorithm demonstrates the effectiveness of simple machine learning techniques in solving classification problems. By accurately predicting the species of iris flowers, this project showcases the practical application of machine learning in real-world scenarios.
